OP Tools is a mod that adds new weapons and armor into the game. I like to call it, "When the game's a bit too hard or boring and I just wanna one-shot everything."

DISCLAIMER:
Just because you have one of these weapons doesn't mean you'll become invincible.

This mod adds new weapons, a new crafting table, and eventually a new ore.
